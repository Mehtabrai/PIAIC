        <div id="_paragraph">
            <div class="_para-1">Dr. Arif Alvi was sworn in as the 13th President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan on 9th September 2018.</div><br>

He was awarded fellowship ‘Diplomatic American Board of Orthodontists (1995)’.</div><br>

He is also an author of a book, theses, and many articles.</div><br>
            <div class="_para-1">Dr. Arif Alvi’s political career commenced with his pro-democracy struggle against the dictatorship of General Ayub Khan. He is a founding member of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that came into being in 1996. He remained a member of the PTI’s Central Executive Committee since its inception and has held the offices of PTI President of Sindh (1997-2001), Central Vice President (2001-2006) and Secretary General (2006-2013). In line with Constitution of Pakistan, he resigned from all the positions of PTI before assuming the prestigious office of the President.</div><br>

Dr. Arif Alvi has keen interest in education and health sectors. Provision of basic facilities to the common man and uplifting the country’s image are very close to his heart. He considers people of Pakistan as the most precious asset and, therefore, accords special focus to human resource development in the country. He is happily married and has four children.</div><br><br><br>
